# Economy Prediction Model

This repository contains the code for the Machine Learning / Deep Learning-based Economy Inflation Prediction Model. The main parameter considered for measuring inflation is CPI (Consumer Price Index).
For reference, if CPI '24 = x and CPI '25 = y, then Inflation Rate from 2024-2025 = [(x-y)/x]*100.
The project is developed using algorithms like Linear Regression and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) during the Research Internship.

## Getting Started

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/suryaanshuu/EconomyPredictionModel.git`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the model using `python main.py`.
