# Economy Prediction Model

* This repository contains the code for the Machine Learning / Deep Learning-based Economy Inflation Prediction Model. The main parameter considered for measuring inflation is CPI (Consumer Price Index).
* For reference, if CPI '24 = x and CPI '25 = y, then Inflation Rate from 2024-2025 = [(x-y)/x]*100.
* The project is developed using algorithms like Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with each depicting certain accuracy in diverse conditions.
